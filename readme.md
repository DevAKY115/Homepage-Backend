# Homepage Backend

This project is part of the homepage frontend. 
The frontend sends requests to the backend, either storing or requesting data.
I used spring boot as a framework.
I use spring data jpa to store the objects in a mysql database.

## Bookmarks
The URLs of the bookmarks are saved and an url of an icon is generated by adding "/favicon.ico" to the host.
It is possible to request all bookmarks, or specific ones, for example when deleting a bookmark.

## Todos
The todos are given a unique generated id and their description and target date are saved.
The usual crud operations are implemented.

## Japanese
A list of vocabularies in japanese can be saved by sending a txt file to the backend.
Every line has to be a new word in the following format:

japaneseWord-translation1,translation2,translation3...,translationX

## Twitter
A request is sent to the Twitter API requesting the 3 most recent posts of a list of my profile.
This request is sent every minute.
There is also an option to request the 100 most recent posts.
The unwanted posts, like retweets and liked posts, are removed.
The remaining posts are saved in the database, and can be requested by the frontend.
